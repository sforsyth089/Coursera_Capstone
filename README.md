### Fancy Restaurant Location - Michigan

<b>Introduction</b>
A chef has saved the money and would like to open a new restaurant somewhere in Micigan. The menu will focus on steak and seafood. The chef plans to have an upscale steak house restaurant and would like to attract appropriate clientele.  The meals will be in above average cost ranges with a variety of innovative side dishes and deserts. The chef thinks downtown Detroit will be the best location, however, would like to run analysis on some data through the whole state of MI in order to be sure to pick the best location. The chef wants to ensure there will be enough business coming in and not too much competition. Therefore average income of nearby cities will be analyzed.

<b> Business Question </b>
The business question: Is downtown Detroit a good location for a restaurant?  If so, which places downtown seem the best?  If not downtown, what other location seems better?

<b> Target Audience </b>
The chef with ultimate decision making power and her group of investors.  This data will allow the chef and her investors to make the best decision before moving forward.

<b> Data Sources </b> 
Foursquare https://foursquare.com/
The venue and location data will be used to assess the best place to open. For example, are similar venues nearby?  That would help show clientele is in the area.  Location information will help answer where exactly to rent a building to open the restaurant.  Foursquare data can also be used to access reviews in order to do some other planning before opening based on client feedback in that area.  Based on popularity of downtown restaurants we are sure we can get enough venue information which is a feature of Foursquare.
