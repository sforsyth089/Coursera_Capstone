### Fancy Restaurant Location - Detroit MI

<b>Introduction</b>
A chef has saved the money and would like to open a new restaurant somewhere in the Detroit area. The menu will focus on steak and seafood. The chef plans to have an upscale steak house restaurant and would like to attract appropriate clientele.  The meals will be in above average cost ranges with a variety of innovative side dishes and deserts. The chef thinks downtown Detroit will be the best location, however, would like to run analysis on some data in order to be sure to pick the best location. The chef wants to ensure there will be enough business coming in and not too much competition. The chef also wants to differentiate from others in the area.

The venue and location data will be used to assess the best place to open. For example, are similar venues nearby?  That would help show clientele is in the area.  Location information will help answer where exactly to rent a building to open the restaurant.  Foursquare data can also be used to access reviews in order to do some other planning before opening based on client feedback in that area.  Based on popularity of downtown restaurants we are sure we can get enough venue information which is a feature of Foursquare.
